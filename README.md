## Abstract

Developer happiness depends on the simplicity of your code. Let's make building web apps simpler.

The talk discusses why simplicity is important, and then covers JS and CSS/SASS specific design patterns, processes and concepts to make building web apps simpler.

## Details

Remember the first month of your project? How did it feel? How does it feel now?

Developer happiness is tied to a feeling of progress. But the ability to progress is hindered by the complexity of that code. By increasing the simplicity of your project you can increase the happiness.

The talk goes through five real world examples, each with a case of unnecessary complexity:

 - Client side APIs
 - Realtime
 - Rate limiting
 - Data binding
 - DOM design

A mechanism to simplify the problem is discussed - in each case a very different fix, but always the result of the same objective assessment. A pattern emerges for assessing complexity of both JS and DOM/SASS solutions.

In doing this, we allow ourselves the ability to read, update, maintain and change our code with the minimum amount of effort - and recover the fun times of that first month. In short: we can keep moving, and stay happy.
